CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/Clion/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1953 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(spdlog) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(spdlog) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set to
  OLD to allow FetchContent_Populate(spdlog) to be called directly for now,
  but the ability to call it with declared details will be removed completely
  in a future version.
